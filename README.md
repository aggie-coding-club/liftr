Liftr iOS/Android Application
=============================

Liftr is an app designed to help people find a workout partner. By individually viewing a snapshot of people’s profiles, the user will swipe left or right indicating their interest in the profile they are viewing. If a user swipes left on a profile, the user will “pass” on the profile and not be matched with that profile again. If a user swipes right on a profile, the user “likes” the profile and can be prompted to open a chat with the user. From there a user can have a conversation with the user of the profile they are viewing, and they can eventually determine plans to meet for a workout.
